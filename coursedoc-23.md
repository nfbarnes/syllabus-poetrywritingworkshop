## Course Description

- **Prerequisites:** English Major or Minor, Junior Standing, and a Grade of C (2.0) or better required in CRW 3013 and CRW 3053, or C.I.
- **UCF Catalog Description:** Poetry Writing Workshop, an intermediate level poetry workshop for English majors. Group analysis and criticism; close reading of contemporary poetry and poetic theory.
- **Description of this section:** This is an intermediate level poetry workshop that will focus on the nature of poetry, the creative process, and the elements present in poems. We will read and discuss the work of contemporary poets, as well as writings on craft and criticism. We will also identify and actively engage with the literary community, our professional field, and consider the role of the poet. 
Although there are no formulas or rules to follow to write good poems, we will establish some guidelines and discuss the qualities most often present in well-crafted poems, i.e., clarity, honesty, significance, control of diction, an attention to the sound of words, the effective use of figurative language, and the use of concrete and specific language.

**Required Course Materials and Texts:** _A Poet’s Companion_ by Kim Addonizio and Dorianne Laux and additional materials provided via Webcourses

Course outcomes:

- **Weekly Readings, Class Discussion, Lecture, and Writing Exercises.** Assigned readings should be complete prior to the class meeting. During class meeting time, we will engage with the content and each other via active discussion, in-class writing, and daily journals.
- **Writing Poems with Process Papers.** Students will build four mini-collections that consist of three poems each. Each poem will be submitted with its own process writing detailing choices, sequence, craft, and use of specific literary devices.
- **Final Focused Portfolio.** In a final focused portfolio, students will propose a theme and structure using selected poems to revise from the semestser as well as one to two new poems to complete the theme. The final portfolio with revision statement is due during our scheduled final exam period and serves as the final evaluation for the course.

## Evaluation and Grading

Students can access their grades and comments at any time using the Gradebook function of Webcourses. All assignments will be submitted through Webcourses. Plan on checking the site at least twice a week for updates and assignment information. Grades are calculated using points following the standard letter scale below:

| 93-100% | A |
| 90-93% | A- |
| 87-89% | B+ |
| 83-86% | B |
| 80-82% | B- |
| 77-79% | C+ |
| 73-76% | C |
| 70-72% | C- |
| 67-69% | C+ |
| 63-66% | C |
| 60-62% | C- |
| Under 60% | F |
I do not give incomplete grades.



| Percentage  | Assignment Category
| 20 | **Poem drafts with Evidence of Experimentation and Risk** 
| 20 | **Building Literary Community** 
| 20 | **Craft Knowledge** 
| 40 | **Final Portfolio** 

Late work is not accepted unless arrangements have been made with the instructor.

I will be grading the individual poems based on challenges and prompts.  You will receive notes from me and your peers. These grades on each poem should point you to areas of craft you need to focus on in revision.

You will include final revisions of four poems in the Final Portfolio. I will read your portfolio and evaluate the overall quality of the writing in it. The traits I generally associate with well-crafted poems include the following:

- clarity
- significant subject matter (as opposed to subjects that hold relatively little importance to the poem’s speaker and its readers — more on this later)
- diction that is fresh and precise
- effective use of concrete, specific language
- effective line breaks
- fresh, evocative metaphors
- effective use of stanza form
- subtlety
- effective use of sound 
- insight into the complexity of human experience (as opposed to poems that display a single, simple emotion or idea)
- compact, concise language
- proficient use of syntax and grammar

PLEASE NOTE: You will pass this course if you complete the requirements in each of the four categories: experimentation, building community, craft knowledge, and portfolio. Generally, students who do well in this class demonstrate the following:

- Successful completion of all course requirements on time
- Improvement of writing through revision
- Writing that is consistently free of syntax, grammar, and spelling errors
- Consistent effort 
- Adherence to course policies

You'll notice that your Final Portfolio is worth 40% of your grade, which means that it may be difficult to tell what your final grade will be until I see how well you've written and revised your poems. (A=outstanding; B=good; C=satisfactory; D=unsatisfactory; F=failing). One thing this means, unfortunately, is that occasionally one may earn a grade lower than they/s/he might have if the grade were calculated solely on the quality of the work. You should take the course requirements and policies seriously. It is important that you work hard on your writing, and also work hard to be a good citizen of the class. The success of a creative writing course—success for each and all—depends largely on your effort given to the class.

An understanding of language and the conventions of written English is a fundamental prerequisite for writing well. Assignments you submit should be free of errors in grammar, punctuation, spelling, syntax, etc. If your work frequently includes such problems, you will likely earn a "C" at the highest.

(In addition, I reserve the right to raise or lower a final grade if special circumstances warrant. Special circumstances that would result in a lowered grade include, for example, behavior that is particularly disruptive or detrimental to the class.)


### Syllabus Amendment

In the event of disruptions during the semester or other circumstances necessitating updates to the syllabus, any amendments will be communicated both in class and through Webcourses.
