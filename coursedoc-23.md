## Course Description

- **Prerequisites:** English Major or Minor, Junior Standing, and a Grade of C (2.0) or better required in CRW 3013 and CRW 3053, or C.I.
- **UCF Catalog Description:** Poetry Writing Workshop, an intermediate level poetry workshop for English majors. Group analysis and criticism; close reading of contemporary poetry and poetic theory.
- **Description of this section:** This is an intermediate level poetry workshop that will focus on the nature of poetry, the creative process, and the elements present in poems. We will read and discuss the work of contemporary poets, as well as writings on craft and criticism. We will also identify and actively engage with the literary community, our professional field, and consider the role of the poet. 
Although there are no formulas or rules to follow to write good poems, we will establish some guidelines and discuss the qualities most often present in well-crafted poems, i.e., clarity, honesty, significance, control of diction, an attention to the sound of words, the effective use of figurative language, and the use of concrete and specific language.

**Required Course Materials and Texts:** _A Poet’s Companion_ by Kim Addonizio and Dorianne Laux and additional materials provided via Webcourses

Course outcomes:

- **Weekly Readings, Class Discussion, Lecture, and Writing Exercises.** Assigned readings should be complete prior to the class meeting. During class meeting time, we will engage with the content and each other via active discussion, in-class writing, and daily journals.
- **Writing Poems with Process Papers.** Students will build four mini-collections that consist of three poems each. Each poem will be submitted with its own process writing detailing choices, sequence, craft, and use of specific literary devices.
- **Final Focused Portfolio.** In a final focused portfolio, students will propose a theme and structure using selected poems to revise from the semestser as well as one to two new poems to complete the theme. The final portfolio with revision statement is due during our scheduled final exam period and serves as the final evaluation for the course.

## Course Objectives

- Understand significant poems and poets with attention to craft
- Develop a working knowledge of liteary devices through readings and applied writing
- Engage the breadth of poem forms, considering style, structure, and authorial choices
- Build close reading skills through iterative annotations, working to incorporate both authoritative interpretations and develop your own insights
- Analyze and critique published works and student-generated texts through process-focused responses

## Evaluation and Grading

Students can access their grades and comments at any time using the Gradebook function of Webcourses. All assignments will be submitted through Webcourses. Plan on checking the site at least twice a week for updates and assignment information. Grades are calculated using points following the standard letter scale below:

| 93-100% | A |
| 90-93% | A- |
| 87-89% | B+ |
| 83-86% | B |
| 80-82% | B- |
| 77-79% | C+ |
| 73-76% | C |
| 70-72% | C- |
| 67-69% | C+ |
| 63-66% | C |
| 60-62% | C- |
| Under 60% | F |
I do not give incomplete grades.



Percentage and Assignment Category
- 20% **Poem drafts with Evidence of Experimentation and Risk** 
- 20% **Building Literary Community** 
- 20% **Craft Knowledge** 
- 40% **Final Portfolio** 

Late work is not accepted unless arrangements have been made with the instructor.

I will be grading the individual poems based on challenges and prompts.  You will receive notes from me and your peers. These grades on each poem should point you to areas of craft you need to focus on in revision.

You will include final revisions of four poems in the Final Portfolio. I will read your portfolio and evaluate the overall quality of the writing in it. The traits I generally associate with well-crafted poems include the following:

- clarity
- significant subject matter (as opposed to subjects that hold relatively little importance to the poem’s speaker and its readers — more on this later)
- diction that is fresh and precise
- effective use of concrete, specific language
- effective line breaks
- fresh, evocative metaphors
- effective use of stanza form
- subtlety
- effective use of sound 
- insight into the complexity of human experience (as opposed to poems that display a single, simple emotion or idea)
- compact, concise language
- proficient use of syntax and grammar

PLEASE NOTE: You will pass this course if you complete the requirements in each of the four categories: experimentation, building community, craft knowledge, and portfolio. Generally, students who do well in this class demonstrate the following:

- Successful completion of all course requirements on time
- Improvement of writing through revision
- Writing that is consistently free of syntax, grammar, and spelling errors
- Consistent effort 
- Adherence to course policies

You'll notice that your Final Portfolio is worth 40% of your grade, which means that it may be difficult to tell what your final grade will be until I see how well you've written and revised your poems. (A=outstanding; B=good; C=satisfactory; D=unsatisfactory; F=failing). One thing this means, unfortunately, is that occasionally one may earn a grade lower than they/s/he might have if the grade were calculated solely on the quality of the work. You should take the course requirements and policies seriously. It is important that you work hard on your writing, and also work hard to be a good citizen of the class. The success of a creative writing course—success for each and all—depends largely on your effort given to the class.

An understanding of language and the conventions of written English is a fundamental prerequisite for writing well. Assignments you submit should be free of errors in grammar, punctuation, spelling, syntax, etc. If your work frequently includes such problems, you will likely earn a "C" at the highest.

(In addition, I reserve the right to raise or lower a final grade if special circumstances warrant. Special circumstances that would result in a lowered grade include, for example, behavior that is particularly disruptive or detrimental to the class.)


### Syllabus Amendment

In the event of disruptions during the semester or other circumstances necessitating updates to the syllabus, any amendments will be communicated both in class and through Webcourses.

## Course Policies

**Attendance:** This is a 3-credit hour course. You know that it meets on campus. If you travel, it is your responsibility to have internet access throughout the semester.

**Academic Engagement Verification Activity: All faculty members are required to document students' academic activity at the beginning of each course. This is administratively mandated and is often linked to financial disbursements and other requirements.

To satisfy this requirement, please complete the following academic activity before the end of the first week of classes (or as soon as possible after adding the course). Failure to do so can result in a delay in the disbursement of your financial aid. It is always due Friday of the first week of classes by 4:59 pm, local time.

**E-mail and Phone Messages:** Please send Inbox messages via Webcourses and email. I will follow University procedures on responding in a timely manner.

**Format for Assignments:** Since we’re using Webcourses/Canvas, you may paste or upload your poems and reading responses in the boxes on the appropriate page. Please format your work with care and follow posted guidelines. In my experience with publishing, literary agents, editors, and magazine readers may disregard your poem if you do not follow their format requirements. In this class, use these opportunities to practice.

**Late Assignments and Make-Up Work:** Usually, I do not accept late work. Please be in touch with me along the way so we can work together. Turning assignments in late will affect your final grade. Assignments that form the basis for something we discuss in class on the day they are due cannot be turned in late or made up.

Per university policy, you are allowed to submit make-up work (or an equivalent, alternate assignment) for authorized university-sponsored activities, religious observances, or legal obligations (such as jury duty). If this participation conflicts with your course assignments, I will offer a reasonable opportunity for you to complete missed assignments and/or exams. The make-up assignment and grading scale will be equivalent to the missed assignment and its grading scale. In the case of an authorized university activity, it is your responsibility to show me official documentation, such as a signed copy of the Program Verification Form for which you will be absent, prior to the class in which the absence occurs. In any of these cases, please contact me ahead of time to notify me of upcoming needs.

If you have a MEDICAL EMERGENCY, please let me know as soon as possible so that I may be involved in determining how to help you.

**Extra Credit:**  There may be extra credit points opportunities listed on assignments.

Should events occur that make it difficult to meet the requirements of this class, it may become necessary for you to withdraw from classes. Please be aware of the University’s calendar and final drop deadlines. Click here to access it. There are many things in life more important than one semester of class/es.

I will present and offer to you experienced, quality, professional instruction. There will likely not be as much time as we would all ideally prefer to workshop all the poems we want. However, I am always able to dialogue with you about your poems. If you have a specific question, please send me a Course Mail and ask. Let's say, for example, that one of your classmates says to cut the last stanza, and another says to leave that stanza in. You can't decide. If I don't place my vote in the discussions, and you really want my insight and opinion, please send me a direct message.

Please send me an email immediately if you notice someone posting a rude response. I am generally gorilla-glued to my computer, but sometimes someone posts something terrible, and I don't see it right away.

For online discussions, if I deem any comments inappropriate for any reason, I will delete them, and that posting will not count as being posted. For in-class discussions, please be respectful of each other as writers, and please also remember that we're not here to form each others' fan base. Let's get to work.


## University Policies

### Academic Integrity

[The Center for Academic Integrity (CAI)](http://academicintegrity.org/) defines academic integrity as a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals into action.

**UCF Creed:** Integrity, scholarship, community, creativity, and excellence are the core values that guide our conduct, performance, and decisions.

1. Integrity: I will practice and defend academic and personal honesty.
2. Scholarship: I will cherish and honor learning as a fundamental purpose of my membership in the UCF community.
3. Community: I will promote an open and supportive campus environment by respecting the rights and contributions of every individual.
4. Creativity: I will use my talents to enrich the human experience.
5. Excellence: I will strive toward the highest standards of performance in any endeavor I undertake.

Students should familiarize themselves with [UCF’s Rules of Conduct](https://scai.sdes.ucf.edu/student-rules-of-conduct/). According to Section 1, “Academic Misconduct,” students are prohibited from engaging in

1. Unauthorized assistance: Using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information or study aids in any academic exercise unless specifically authorized by the instructor of record. The unauthorized possession of examination or course-related material also constitutes cheating.
2. Communication to another through written, visual, electronic, or oral means: The presentation of material which has not been studied or learned, but rather was obtained through someone else’s efforts and used as part of an examination, course assignment, or project.
3. Commercial Use of Academic Material: Selling of course material to another person, student, and/or uploading course material to a third-party vendor without authorization or without the express written permission of the university and the instructor. Course materials include but are not limited to class notes, Instructor’s PowerPoints, course syllabi, tests, quizzes, labs, instruction sheets, homework, study guides, handouts, etc.
4. Falsifying or misrepresenting the student’s own academic work.
5. Plagiarism: Using or appropriating another’s work without any indication of the source, thereby attempting to convey the impression that such work is the student’s own.
6. Multiple Submissions: Submitting the same academic work for credit more than once without the express written permission of the instructor.
7. Helping another violate academic behavior standards.
8. Soliciting assistance with academic coursework and/or degree requirements.

### Responses to Academic Dishonesty, Plagiarism, or Cheating

Students should also familiarize themselves with the procedures for academic misconduct in UCF’s student handbook, [The Golden Rule](https://goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu/). UCF faculty members have a responsibility for students’ education and the value of a UCF degree, and so seek to prevent unethical behavior and respond to academic misconduct when necessary. Penalties for violating rules, policies, and instructions within this course can range from a zero on the exercise to an “F” letter grade in the course. In addition, an Academic Misconduct report could be filed with the Office of Student Conduct, which could lead to disciplinary warning, disciplinary probation, or deferred suspension or separation from the University through suspension, dismissal, or expulsion with the addition of a “Z” designation on one’s transcript.

#### NOTE: In a creative writing course (such as this one), UCF's Academic Honesty Policy means that all work is original, created by the student during this semester course.

### Course Accessibility Statement

This course is built with universal design for learning principles in mind: if you encounter challenges with any of the course materials, assignments, platforms, or requirements, please reach out for assistance, and know that additional support is always available regardles of documentation.

Additionally, the University of Central Florida is committed to providing access and inclusion for all persons with disabilities. Students with disabilities who need access to course content due to course design limitations should contact the professor as soon as possible. Students should also connect with [Student Accessibility Services (SAS)](http://sas.sdes.ucf.edu/) (Ferrell Commons 185, sas@ucf.edu, phone 407-823-2371). For students connected with SAS, a Course Accessibility Letter may be created and sent to professors, which informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might be necessary and reasonable. Determining reasonable access and accommodations requires consideration of the course design, course learning objectives and the individual academic and course barriers experienced by the student. Further conversation with SAS, faculty and the student may be warranted to ensure an accessible course experience.

### Land Acknowledgement Statement

The UCF Department of English acknowledges that our main campus stands on the traditional territories of the Seminole and Timucua peoples, and that other Native American traditional territories exist throughout Florida where our regional campuses are located. We collectively recognize their continuing connection to the land, water, and air and pay respect to their elders past, present, and emerging. We recognize the continuing consequences of colonialism on Indigenous peoples and their resilience in the face of colonial and state sponsored violence, and we fully endorse Indigenous Sovereignty.

### Campus Safety Statement

Emergencies on campus are rare, but if one should arise during class, everyone needs to work together. Students should be aware of their surroundings and familiar with some basic safety and security concepts.

- In case of an emergency, dial 911 for assistance.
- Every UCF classroom contains an emergency procedure guide posted on a wall near the door. Students should make a note of the guide’s physical location and review the [online version](http://emergency.ucf.edu/emergency_guide.html).
- Students should know the evacuation routes from each of their classrooms and have a plan for finding safety in case of an emergency.
- If there is a medical emergency during class, students may need to access a first-aid kit or AED (Automated External Defibrillator). To learn where those are located, see [locations](https://ehs.ucf.edu/automated-external-defibrillator-aed-locations).
- To stay informed about emergency situations, students can sign up to receive UCF text alerts by going to [MyUCF](https://my.ucf.edu) and logging in. Click on “Student Self Service” located on the left side of the screen in the toolbar, scroll down to the blue “Personal Information” heading on the Student Center screen, click on “UCF Alert”, fill out the information, including e-mail address, cell phone number, and cell phone provider, click “Apply” to save the changes, and then click “OK.”
- Students with special needs related to emergency situations should speak with their instructors outside of class.
- To learn about how to manage an active-shooter situation on campus or elsewhere, consider viewing this [video](https://youtu.be/NIKYajEx4pk).

### Deployed Active Duty Military Students

Students who are deployed active duty military and/or National Guard personnel and require accommodation should contact their instructors as soon as possible after the semester begins and/or after they receive notification of deployment to make related arrangements.

### Authorized Events and Religious Observances

Students who represent the university in an authorized event or activity (for example, student-athletes) and who are unable to meet a course deadline due to a conflict with that event must provide the instructor with documentation in advance to arrange a make-up. No penalty will be applied.

Students must notify their instructor in advance if they intend to miss class for a religious observance. For more information, see the [UCF policy](http://regulations.ucf.edu/chapter5/documents/5.020ReligiousObservancesFINALJan19.pdf).
